    <p>Jesus Dela Peña National High School was established through the effort of Honorable Mayor Marcelino R. Teodoro,who was then a Congressman.<br>
         He authored a bill creating a high school in Barangay Jesus Dela Peña which was approved on July 23, 2012,<br>
         known as Republic Act No. 10216.  Despite the challenges, the program is successful and continuously improving.</p>

      <p>Continuous Advocacy Campaign and Enrollment</p>
      <p>The Division Office conducts continuous advocacy campaigns and programs to disseminate the information to the field and at the same time to attract future enrollees. The two implementing schools post tarpaulins of the eLearning program at their facade. <br>
      The class advisers discuss the program to the parents during Parents - Teachers Conference (PTC) or in any event or activity of the school if given a chance.<br>
      This is to sustain the enrollment and to ensure maximum participation of the stakeholders for the success of the eLearning program.<br>
      
      The administrators are looking for partners who believe in the project and who can help support the financial need of the program.<br>
      
      This Office is looking forward to implement this program up to Senior High School.</p>
